Web clients and servers can communicate in real-time, in both directions using Socket.IO. The application can be opened by multiple users at once, and messages can be sent. The server will manage the clients real-time communication, allowing them to send and receive messages instantly.",

In this project, we tried to design a smart health monitoring device that measured SPO2 (percentage of oxygen in the blood) and heart rate. The best part of this idea is that it can be linked to an app that automatically records all of the sensor data to a text file. we digitalized the device with a processor and fan, and used Arduino IOT and cloud to get the results on screen. My contribution was primarily in the area of connections",
